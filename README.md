# WordPress Admin Login Notification Plugin

This plugin sends an email notification to the website administrator when they log in to their WordPress dashboard. This can be helpful for website owners who want to keep track of who is logging in to their site and when.

## Installation

1. Upload the `wp-admin-login-notification` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! The plugin will automatically send an email notification to the site administrator when they log in to the WordPress dashboard.

## Customization

This plugin allows you to customize the email message that is sent to the site administrator. You can edit the email subject and message body in the plugin settings page.

## Security Note

To protect user data, this plugin does not include any user information in the email notification. Instead, it stores the user ID and user information in custom user fields in the WordPress database. This ensures that sensitive user information is not exposed in the event of a security breach.

Enjoy!
